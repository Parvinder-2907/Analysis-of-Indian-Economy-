Analysis of Indian Economy using excel and tableau

Introduction

Analyzing data is an important process by which we derive significant inferences about a large data. About a particular topic we might have data in lakhs of rows and columns we cannot possibly go through each and every entry and then reach a conclusion. For that we require assistance of tools like tableau and excel. Data analysis organizes, interprets, structures, and presents the data into useful information that provides context for the data.	

In my project I have taken a dataset that accounts all the information regarding Indian Economy from the year 1960 to 2019. Which involves

GDP: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services.

Per capita GDP: Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is a metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population.

Inflation Rate: The inflation rate is the rate at which the general rise in the level of prices, goods and services in an economy occurs and how it affects the cost of living of those living in a particular country.

GNP: Gross National Product (GNP) is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad. Description: GNP measures the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced by the country's factors of production irrespective of their location.

Exports:  Exports are goods and services that are produced domestically, but then sold to customers residing in other countries. Exports lead to an inflow of funds to the seller's country since export transactions involve selling domestic goods and services to foreign buyers.

Imports are defined as goods produced outside the boundaries of one country, which are then purchased by that country. A greater proportion of imports relative to a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) indicates a country's degree of dependence on purchases from abroad.
